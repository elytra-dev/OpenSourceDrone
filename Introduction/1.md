# Introduction

Every single OSD variant will deal with:
1. Sensors
2. Microcontroller (essentially the Flight Controller)
3. Wiring diagrams
4. Code

Every variant will have a defined problem statement (eg. WiFi controllable drone with RGB LED integration), the project will then deal with used microcontrollers and sensors/modules that help achieve the desired result. In many cases, it will be upto the user to use their own:

1. BLDC/Coreless DC motors
2. Propellers
3. Frame or other attachments
4. Battery
5. Radio communication (if the problem statement does not explicitly mention it)
6. 3D printed parts

The introduction tab will also deal with indepth knowledge of what these different parts mean, how to utilise them effectively.
